                <p> We’re a group of students from the University of Maryland. As members of the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students (ACES) honors college, we believe technological literacy enables users to make smart decisions and protect themselves from malicious actors, and we\’re committed to bringing education to our communities. Our aim in creating TerpSecure was to make a platform which is accessible for all users regardless of prior knowledge of cybersecurity. We understand that computers can sometimes be an intimidating topic, and we hope that TerpSecure makes learning fun, interesting, and easy. 


We decided to create TerpSecure as our project for the Northrop Grumman 2016 Cyber Engineering competition. They provided us with a Raspberry Pi, funding, and guidance—we coded the rest! The project gave us a fantastic opportunity to develop new skills and explore different areas of development while also creating a useful product. We really enjoyed the development experience, and we hope users will enjoy exploring our finished project.
