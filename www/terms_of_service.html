                        <p> Next time you're on a website, read the terms and conditions carefully. Keep an eye out for terms
                        that grant a company the right to collect and sell your information. In addition, be aware of conditions
                        that state that the compnany is not respnsible for any misuse of personal data. This should be a red flag!</p>
